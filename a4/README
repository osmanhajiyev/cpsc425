             Sample code for Assignment 5 of CPSC 425
             --------------------------------------

The program SIFTmatch.py contains sample Python code for reading images and
their invariant keypoints.  It also shows how to display the images and draw
lines connecting keypoints from each image.  See the comments in SIFTmatch.py
for details.

The directory also contains some sample images and their keypoints, which have
already been extracted and stored in associated files.

You can run the matching program on the sample data by typing

  python SIFTmatch.py

at the command prompt (starting it from this directory).

The built-in example is

  match('scene', 'basmati')

You can edit the file to try

  match('scene', 'book')
  match('scene', 'box')

Finally,

   match('library2','library')

shows two images of Main Library at UBC taken from different viewpoints

Creating SIFT features for new images
-------------------------------------

This is not part of the required assignment, but if you wish to try the
program on new images, you can run the "keypoints" program (compiled for
Linux) in this directory as follows:

% keypoints <image.pgm >image.key

This will generate the keypoint file image.key that can be used in the
same way as the other .key files that have been provided.
